Usage
=====
### Yocto Poky
1. Checkout the branch which corresponds with your version of Yocto
2. Add the `meta-intel-realsense` layer to `conf/bblayers.conf` in your `build` directory
```bitbake
    BBLAYERS += "path/to/meta-intel-realsense"
```
3. Add dependency layers to `conf/bblayers.conf` in your `build` directory
```bitbake
    BBLAYERS += "path/to/meta-openembedded/meta-oe"
```
4. Create a new `conf/auto.conf` file in your `build` directory with the following contents
```bitbake
    require include/intel-librealsense.inc
```
5. Include librealsense in your image by adding the following to `conf/auto.conf`
```bitbake
    CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "librealsense2 librealsense2-tools"

    # Optional
    CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "librealsense2-debug-tools"
```
### Samples
To include sample apps in your image add the following to `conf/auto.conf`
```bitbake
    CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "librealsense2-examples"
```
If you are building an image with a graphical desktop you can also add the following
```bitbake
    CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "librealsense2-graphical-examples"
```

### Python
To include Python support in your image include the following in your `conf/auto.conf`

```bitbake
    # Python 2.x
    CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "python-pyrealsense2"
